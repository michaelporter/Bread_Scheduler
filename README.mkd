Usage:

Make bin/Bread_Scheduler.rb executable and run in your terminal (you'll also probably need to change the shebang path to point to your ruby install).  It'll take you the rest of the way.



Mike's Baking Scheduler v1.0

What it can do:
  <br />-You give it your starting time, and the rise and baking times for each bread you want to bake on the given day, and it'll give you the most efficient schedule it can manage for that day.
  <br />-Takes into account the number of loaf pans and ovens you have access to.
  <br />-Accounts for kitchen temperature's effect on rise times.
  <br />-Easy to edit baking days' start times and all bread info.
  
What it can't do (yet):
  <br />-Save baking schedules...or breads...(coming soonish though)...
  
Future of the Project:
  <br />-A web application that allows for the creation of user accounts, stored breads, and easy sharing of recipes off-site.
Enjoy!

Dependencies:
